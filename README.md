# traveller
Traveller project, a 3D animated scene with the Sun, stars and stencil shadows made with Irrlicht3D
 A simple scene, containing a desert-like landscape with empty trees, day/ night cycle set by the user through shortcut keys, navigation keys, animals
 Landscape through heightmap. Trees are randomly placed and scaled. Animals are animated meshes frame-based, non-skinned.
 A mirror is also on the scene, in order to see what's behind when navigating. Navigation keys - arrows and WASD. Jump with space. You can jump on the trees.
 Everything on the scene, except perhaps birds, are in Irrlicht-triangle selector, that is, the collision works for it.
 
 The most interesting part, is the night sky: The Moon, with basic texture is there in Full-Moon-phase and the stars too, according to their real magnitude and color.
 Moreover, the user can toggle the visibility of their names. The star catalog is also there.
 
 Prospected work: Random infinite heightmap, random tree shapes, more animals, a train track and trains on it. Is even possible with last version of Irrlicht?
